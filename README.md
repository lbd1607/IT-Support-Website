# IT-Support-Website
This is a web app intended to make IT support more efficient. The website content is divided into 3 categories: Self-help (docs),
emergency assistance (contact info), and IT help (ticket system).

This app requires an Apache server to be running on localhost to access any portion of the ticket system.
